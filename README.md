A high-performance interactive map for exploring Seattle's urban forest in 3D.

Visualization is powered by **Deck.GL**, rendering detailed tree models at scale across the city. The application utilizes **SDOT (Seattle Department of Transportation)** open data to provide real-time information on street trees.

Click individual trees to view species, diameter, and status. It integrates **Wikipedia** summaries for educational context and provides **filtered views** by genus.

The project is built using **React 19**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript** for a modern, responsive experience.
